  <p>My name is Guang-He Lee. I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student working with Professor <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/" target="_blank">Tommi S. Jaakkola</a> in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p>

  <p>Previously, I received my M.S./B.S. from the Department of CSIE at NTU in June 2017/2015, when I worked with Professor <a href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/" target="_blank">Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen</a> in my M.S. and Professor <a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sdlin/" target="_blank">Shou-De Lin</a> in my B.S. I have been honored with the <b>NTU Presidential Award</b> every semester between 2011-2015, the <b>Microsoft-IEEE Young Fellowship</b> in 2014, and the <b>Irving T. Ho Memorial Scholarship</b> in 2013 and 2014. I graduated from my B.S. with second-highest marks in my class of 111 students. The Department subsequently nominated me as an <b>Honorary Member of the Phi Tau Phi Scholastic Honor Society</b>.</p>

  <!--<p>I have published one conference paper (<a href="pub/icdm15-lambdaMF.pdf">pdf</a>) in the <b><i>Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining</i></b> (ICDM). Due to my outstanding performance when interning at Intel Labs in June-September 2015, Intel filed <b>4 international patent applications</b> on my behalf; During my junior and senior years of study, I participated in several competitions and fortunately received <b>12th Place</b> at KDD Cup 2014, <b>Excellent Performance Award</b> at TSMC Big Data Competition, the biggest annual data mining competition in Taiwan, in 2014, and 2 <b>First Place</b> and 1 <b>Second Place</b> at the Undergraduate Research Project Exhibition Awards co-organized by NTU CSIE, Appier Inc., and Delta Inc. in 2015.</p>
